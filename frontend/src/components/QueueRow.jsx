// Home's progress row for a coach week (S.queue) — it stands in for the seven weekday dots
// while a planner-written queue runs the week, because its sessions have no weekday: they are done in
// order, on whatever days you train. One chip per session in slot order; the next undone one
// is lit, and any undone chip starts its own routine, in whatever order the day calls for. A
// done chip is inert: that session is logged. A session pinned to another day (the day sheet,
// S.dayPlan) is not lit and wears its day instead of a state word — it still starts on a tap.
// Reads through queueView so the words here and the today row (effectiveRoutineIds →
// queueNext) can never disagree about which is next.
