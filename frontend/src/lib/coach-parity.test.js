/* The server's copies of three tiny reading rules, pinned against the frontend's originals.
 *
 * api/coach/payload.js re-implements modeOf, isBw and isPerSide because the api container has
 * no build step in common with the frontend and does not copy frontend/ into its image. That
 * trade-off is fine; what is not fine is the copy drifting, which is exactly what happened
 * when v1.2.4 taught the app about bodyweight work and per-side reps: the server kept reading
 * every set as a loaded rep set, so a push-up progression that was working would have looked
 * like a stalled bench press with the weight left at zero.
 *
 * This test only runs under vitest, which can load both runtimes. It compares behaviour over a
 * table of configs rather than comparing source, so the two are free to be written differently
 * as long as they answer the same.
