/* Two copies of the account state, one merged copy.
 *
 * The server refuses a push over a document the device never saw (PUT /api/data with a stale
 * `baseRev` answers 409 and hands back the current document). Before revisions the newer `_ts`
 * simply replaced the other copy wholesale — which is exactly how a desktop tab that sat open
 * all day dropped the workout the phone logged in the meantime. The merge keeps both sides'
 * entries and lets the newer copy decide everything that has no natural union.
 *
 * Rules, by field:
 *   - scalars and settings, `week`, `dayPlan`, `wc`, `reminder`, …: from the copy with the newer `_ts`
 *   - workouts, routines, customEx, equipProfiles, gymCards: union by id, the newer copy's version
 *     of an id that both have; workouts sorted by day and start like every other writer
 *   - bodyweight: union by day, the later-edited (`t`) entry of a day that both have
 *   - favEx: ordered set union, the newer copy first
 *   - exWeights: union by exercise, the better `w` for that exercise — larger for an ordinary
 *     lift, smaller on an assistance machine (a PR logged on the other device must not be
 *     forgotten, whichever way it runs); exNotes, barWeights: key union
 *   - `_ts`: the later of the two; `_rev` dropped (the server sets it); `active` left to the caller
 *
 * Known limit: with no record of what each side deleted, an entry removed on one device inside
 * the conflict window comes back from the other. The window is a few seconds now (the store pulls
 * on resume and every push is conditional), and a resurrected entry beats a lost one. Tombstones
 * would close it.
