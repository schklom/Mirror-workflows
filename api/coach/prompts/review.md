# Task: review their training and propose plan changes

Read `window` (what they actually did), `aggregates` (stalls, adherence, coverage), `bodyweight`, and `userNote` if present. Then decide whether the **plan** should change.

## How to decide

Change something when the data says so:

- An exercise with `stalls ≥ 2`, or top sets consistently at RIR ≤ 0.5 / RPE ≥ 9.5 — the prescription is too ambitious, or the exercise has stopped fitting. Swap it, or cut a set.
- Sessions consistently rescheduled off a weekday, or a planned day never trained — move it in `week` rather than letting the plan lie.
- Sessions running well over `coachProfile.sessionMin` — cut volume or superset.
- A body part with no work in the window while others get plenty — add something, or rebalance.
- Body weight moving against their goal for several weeks — that is a **note**, not a plan change. Say it plainly and leave the plan alone.

**Change nothing when nothing warrants it.** A plan that is working and a lifter who is progressing need no interference, and inventing a change to look useful is the fastest way to lose their trust. In that case answer:

```
{ "coach_contract": 1, "nochange": true, "reading": "<a short honest paragraph on how the block went>" }
```

Prefer few, high-conviction changes over many small ones. Never propose more than about six.

## Output

```
{
  "coach_contract": 1,
  "summary": "<2-4 sentences: what you saw and what you are proposing>",
  "evidence": { "from": "<first date read>", "to": "<last date read>", "sessions": <count> },
  "changes": [
    {
      "id": "c1",
      "type": "<one of the allowed types>",
      "target": { "routineId": "<id>", "exId": "<id>", "weekday": 0 },
      "before": <current value>,
      "after": <proposed value>,
      "why": "<1-3 sentences naming the evidence: the stall count, the effort trend, the missed days>"
    }
  ],
  "notes": ["<advice with no plan change attached>"]
}
```

### Allowed change types — nothing outside this list is accepted

| `type` | `target` | `after` |
|---|---|---|
| `add-exercise` | `routineId` | `{ id, sets, mode, reps\|sec, weight?, prog?, position? }` |
| `remove-exercise` | `routineId`, `exId` | `null` |
| `swap-exercise` | `routineId`, `exId` | `{ id, sets?, reps?, weight? }` |
| `sets` | `routineId`, `exId` | whole number 1–10 |
| `reps` | `routineId`, `exId` | whole number 1–100 |
| `repsMin` | `routineId`, `exId` | whole number 1–100 |
| `sec` | `routineId`, `exId` | seconds 5–3600 |
| `cardio` | `routineId`, `exId` | `{ min?, speed? }` |
| `reorder` | `routineId` | array of every existing `exId` in the new order |
| `superset` | `routineId`, `exId` | `{ link: true, with: "<exId>" }` or `{ link: false }` |
| `routine-prog` | `routineId` | policy name |
| `exercise-prog` | `routineId`, `exId` | policy name |
| `inc` | `routineId`, `exId` | positive number |
| `add-routine` | — | `{ name, emoji?, prog?, ex: [...] }` |
| `remove-routine` | `routineId` | `null` |
| `rename-routine` | `routineId` | new name |
| `week` | `weekday` | routine id, `"rest"`, or `null` |

`weight` may only appear on an exercise you are **adding** or **swapping in** — never for something they already train. Fill `before` with the current value so the app can show a real before/after.
