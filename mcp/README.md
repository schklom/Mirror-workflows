# openGym MCP server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) bridge that lets an external LLM
application (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Continue, etc.) read your openGym profile —
routines, workouts, body-weight log, estimated 1RMs, and muscle balance — directly from your
self-hosted `./data` directory.

It is read-only, runs locally as a stdio process spawned by the LLM client, adds no new
container, and requires no extra authentication. The LLM never sees passkeys, VAPID keys, or
session secrets — it can only read the same `state-<uid>.json` files the openGym api already
writes.

The numbers it answers with are computed by the **same pure functions the React UI uses**
(`frontend/src/lib/*.js`) — `estimate1RM`, `loadOfWorkouts`, `effectiveRoutine`, etc. — so a
"what's my bench 1RM?" answer matches the Stats screen exactly.

> Phase 1 of a multi-phase plan. Read-only today; long-lived token auth + write tools are
> planned but not shipped yet. See **Roadmap** below.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
cd mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Point it at your data

The MCP server reads the same `./data` directory `docker compose up` creates. Pick the profile
to answer for — its user id is in `./data/db.json` under `users[].id`:

```bash
# single-user instance (the common self-hosted case) — auto-detected:
node src/index.js

# multi-user instance, or just to be explicit:
OPENGYM_UID=<your-uid> OPENGYM_DATA=/path/to/openGym/data node src/index.js
```

### 3. Register with your LLM client

Add the server to your LLM client's MCP config. For Claude Desktop, edit
`claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opengym": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/openGym/mcp/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENGYM_DATA": "/absolute/path/to/openGym/data",
        "OPENGYM_UID": "<your-uid>"   // optional — auto-detected if you have one profile
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Cursor and other MCP-compatible clients, see the client's MCP docs — the same `command` +
`args` + `env` shape is what every stdio MCP server expects.

Restart the client; you should see the openGym tools appear with "serving profile \<name\>" on
the server's stderr.

## Tools

Eight read-only tools in v1:

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `list_routines` | What routines are saved in my profile? (names + exercise counts) |
| `get_routine` | What does the Push Day routine prescribe? (sets/reps/weight per exercise) |
| `get_week_plan` | What's on my plan this week, including today with any date-specific override? |
| `list_workouts` | Recent sessions — newest first, with dates, sets done/planned, volume, duration, PRs. |
| `get_workout` | Full set-by-set breakdown of one session, by `workout_id` or by date. On a day with two sessions the date alone returns both ids to pick from rather than guessing at one. |
| `get_bodyweight` | Weigh-ins with the latest weight, the goal line, and deltas vs goal. |
| `estimate_1rm` | All-time best 1RM for an exercise + the trend, or a PR table across all exercises. |
| `muscle_balance` | Which muscles I've trained this week/month/all-time, ranked + which I've neglected. |

Each tool returns JSON the LLM can format as it likes; structured fields (sets, dates, levels)
are pre-formatted into human-readable labels in `src/labels.js` so the LLM doesn't need to
re-interpret them.

## How it reuses the training logic

The MCP server imports the training helpers under `frontend/src/lib/` directly as Node ESM
and calls the same functions the React UI does (`history.js`, `onerm.js`, `muscles.js`,
`exercises.js`). The numbers it returns match what the Stats screen shows, because they are
the same code.

The one lib file that wasn't Node-safe was `i18n.js` (Vite's `import.meta.glob` at module
top level) — split into `i18n-core.js` (pure, Node-safe) + `i18n.js` (Vite/React bits,
re-exports from core). `exercises.js` got a one-line `import.meta.env || {}` guard. No new
dependencies landed in `frontend/`, no public exports changed.

## Design constraints honoured

- **One runtime dependency beyond the MCP SDK:** none. No database driver, no HTTP framework.
- **No new container.** stdio transport is spawned by the LLM client; nothing to add to
  `docker-compose.yml`.
- **No new auth.** The filesystem is the boundary — same as `docker compose` running on the
  user's box. No passkey material, VAPID keys, or session secrets ever cross it.
- **No telemetry, no network.** Reads `./data/*.json` and exits when the LLM client
  disconnects.

## Tests

```bash
cd mcp && npm test
```

32 cases seeding state from `frontend/src/lib/demoSeed.js` (the same deterministic fixture
the public demo runs on). Pins JSON shape and the user-facing edge cases: rest-day override,
missing routine, zero-workout history, no synced state, superset links, three 1RM formulas.
"Today" is pinned via `vi.useFakeTimers({ now: ..., toFake: ['Date'] })` so date-dependent
tools see consistent values regardless of when the suite runs. The pure lib functions have
their own 92 tests in `frontend/src/lib/*.test.js`.

## Roadmap

- **Done (Phase 1):** read-only stdio, 8 tools, direct `./data` access.
- **Phase 1.5:** a `progression_next` tool (what does the policy prescribe next?). No new
  deps; small surface area.
- **Phase 2:** read+write over stdio. Requires a long-lived token auth path minted from the
  admin dashboard (new `./data/tokens.json`) and a write-lock against the web UI's read-modify-
  write of `state-<uid>.json`. Tools: `log_workout`, `add_bodyweight`, `edit_routine`,
  `assign_weekday`, `override_day`.
- **Phase 3:** Streamable HTTP transport, opt-in 4th container in `docker-compose.yml`. Same
  tool implementations, second transport — the MCP SDK supports both behind one tool registration.
