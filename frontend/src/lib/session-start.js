 * and a policy that moves reps (double progression, bodyweight, a timed hold) still moving them
 * from there. 'last': the reps you logged last time, the way every planned session opened before
 * this setting existed. A profile saved before it, or one that never chose, reads as 'plan'.

 * so an entry cannot come out differently depending on where it was made. `routine` is the one
 * the exercise is planned in: its own history comes first (#216) and its policy applies.
 * `noProg` builds the routine's own numbers with no prescription, as an excluded routine does.
