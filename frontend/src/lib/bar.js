// Per-exercise bar weight (issue: plate math for barbell work). Logged weights stay the
// TOTAL on the bar — history, progression and 1RM keep meaning exactly what they always
// did. The bar weight is display metadata: it feeds the "X per side" plate math and
// nothing else.
//
// Unit: stored in the profile unit (S.unit), like every other weight in state — set
// weights, exWeights, bodyweight are all written in whatever unit the profile logs and a
// unit switch re-labels them without converting. A canonical-kg bar would be the one
// number that shifts under the user on a unit switch while the totals around it stay
// put, so the override follows the same rule. The equipment *defaults* therefore exist
// per unit too: a kg profile gets the 20 kg olympic bar, a lb profile the 45 lb bar its
// gym actually racks — not a 44.1 lb conversion no bar is stamped with.
