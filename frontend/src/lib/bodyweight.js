// Weigh-ins read back week by week (Discord 'Weight'). From one morning to the next, body weight
// moves with water, salt and the last meal by more than it moves in a month, so the number worth
// following is the week's mean — the one a single weigh-in on the card cannot give you.

/**
 * The weigh-ins grouped into weeks, newest week first. Each week carries its mean, how many
 * weigh-ins it holds, the change of its mean from the week before it that has any (null for the
 * first), and its entries newest first. `ws` is the first day of the week (weekStartOf), so the
 * weeks are the ones the calendar and the week strip show. The stored order is not relied on,
 * and an entry with no day or no weight is skipped rather than averaged in as 0.
 * Returns [{ key, avg, n, delta, entries }], `key` being the iso date the week starts on.
