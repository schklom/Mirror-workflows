/* The iOS keyboard leaves the page displaced.
 *
 * On iOS Safari (and the home-screen PWA) the keyboard does not resize the layout viewport;
 * it scrolls the page so the focused field is visible, even when the body is pinned by an
 * open sheet. When the keyboard goes away again, the scroll it made is not always undone:
 * the layout viewport stays offset inside the screen, everything `position:fixed` — the tab
 * bar, the rest timer — sits where the layout viewport ends, i.e. mid-screen, and the page's
 * first rows hide under the status bar. It stays like that until something scrolls.
 *
 * The exercise picker is where it bites: search, tap "+", the sheet stays open, the keyboard
 * closes — and the sheet's own restore (Modals.jsx) has not run because nothing closed. So the
 * correction lives here, on the window, and fires whenever the keyboard has just gone away or
 * a text field lost focus: if the visual viewport is not where the layout viewport is, ask for
 * the scroll position we already have. iOS treats that as a scroll and realigns the viewports;
 * on every other platform it is a no-op.
