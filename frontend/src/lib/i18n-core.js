   English has two forms and the source strings are the keys, so a count used to be
   written `t(n === 1 ? '{0} set' : '{0} sets', n)` and every pack inherited that
   two-way split. Russian, Ukrainian and Polish have three (1 подход, 2 подхода,
   5 подходов) and Arabic six, so those packs could only pick the least wrong of two
   — "2 подходов" — or dodge the grammar entirely, which is why the Russian pack
   reads "Упражнений: {0}" where a person would say "2 упражнения".

   The rule itself comes from the platform, the same way fmtAgo takes relative time
   from Intl.RelativeTimeFormat: no pack carries a rule, only its own forms. A pack
   answers a plural key with either a plain string (unchanged, still correct for every
   two-form language) or an object keyed by CLDR category:

     '{0} sets': { one: '{0} подход', few: '{0} подхода', many: '{0} подходов' }

   Keys stay the English plural, so a pack that says nothing new behaves as before. */
