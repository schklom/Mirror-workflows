# Contributing to openGym

Thanks for taking a look. openGym is deliberately small and light on dependencies, and the aim is
to keep it that way: easy to read, easy to self-host.

## Project layout

```
frontend/  React + Vite app (src/views, src/components, src/store, src/lib). Builds to static files.
           android/ and ios/ are the Capacitor shells for the standalone app (docs/MOBILE.md).
api/       Backend: server.js on plain node:http, two dependencies (@simplewebauthn/server, web-push).
           coach/ is the optional AI coach; openapi.yaml documents every route.
web/       Multi-stage Dockerfile (builds the frontend, serves it with nginx) and the nginx template.
mcp/       Optional read-only MCP server for LLM clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, ...). Not in the
           Docker build; it only runs when a client spawns it. See mcp/README.md.
website/   The static project site at opengym.duarte-santos.ch.
kubernetes/ Example manifests (docs/SELF_HOSTING_KUBERNETES.md).
docs/      User and operator guides (index: docs/README.md); docs/dev/ has feature design notes.
media/     Exercise images and GIFs, gitignored and fetched at runtime.
```

## Running for development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build      # api + web + media on :8080

cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # hot reload, proxies /api to :3000
cd frontend && npm test                     # training logic, locales, components
cd api && npm test
cd mcp && npm test
```

## Guidelines

- **Keep it dependency-light.** The frontend uses React, React Router and Zustand; `api/` has two
  dependencies. A new dependency on either side is a hard sell.
- **Match the style.** Small components, clear names, comments only where the *why* isn't obvious.
  State lives in the Zustand store (`src/store`), pure helpers in `src/lib`. There is no linter or
  formatter config, so follow the surrounding code.
- **Don't commit** `media/` or `data/`; both are gitignored.
- **Click through what you touched**, including the workout flow, in a browser before opening a
  pull request.
- **Training logic gets a unit test.** Anything that decides what you lift next, or reads a logged
  session back, belongs in a pure helper in `src/lib` with a test beside it. These rules are easy
  to get subtly wrong and nearly impossible to check by clicking; the progression engine has had
  real bugs that only a test caught.
- **New UI strings go into every locale** in `frontend/src/locales/`. English is the source
  language and has no file. `node scripts/check-locales.mjs` (run in CI) flags a key that is
  missing, blank or has lost a `{n}` placeholder. Portuguese (Brazil) inherits from Portuguese
  (Portugal) and has its own guard test.

## Using AI tools

openGym itself is developed with Claude Code (see
[How openGym is built](README.md#how-opengym-is-built)), and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) holds the
project context for it. You're welcome to use whatever tools you like for a pull request. The bar
is the same either way: you understand the change, it's tested, and you can answer questions about
it in review.

## What CI does with your pull request

<p align="center">
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/diagrams/ci-dark.png">
  <img src="docs/diagrams/ci.png" alt="CI path: pull request on GitHub, GitHub Actions tests and image builds, review and merge into main, mirror workflow pushes to GitLab, GitLab CI builds the signed APK, images and SBOMs, GHCR images on release." width="280">
</picture>
</p>

A pull request runs the three test suites and builds and boots both api image targets. The APK and
the published images come from GitLab CI on the mirror, built from `main` after the merge. If your
change needs an APK to be judged, say so in the pull request and a maintainer will run that build.
A first-time contributor's workflows wait for a maintainer to approve them, so "no checks yet"
just means nobody has pressed the button.

Merge requests still open on the GitLab mirror are reviewed too and land on `main` here. New work
should come as a GitHub pull request.

## Good first issues

- More starter plans
- More languages for the exercise instructions (the dataset ships several)
- Percentage or training-max programming (5/3/1 style) on top of the progression engine in
  `src/lib/progression.js`; the policy interface is already there
- Accessibility passes on the workout and chart screens

## Where to ask what

| You have | Goes to |
| --- | --- |
| A quick question, or you'd rather chat | [Discord](https://discord.gg/e62jY6fwVb) |
| A question, or self-hosting that won't behave | [Discussions → Q&A](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/discussions/categories/q-a) |
| An idea you're not sure about yet | [Discussions → Ideas](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/discussions/categories/ideas) |
| A reproducible bug | [Issues](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/issues) |
| A change you've already built | [A pull request](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/pulls) |
| A security problem | [Private report](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/security/advisories/new), see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) |

An answered question in Discussions is worth more than the same answer in a chat log, because the
next person searching "passkey login fails behind my reverse proxy" finds it. If a Discord answer
turns out to be worth keeping, it belongs in Discussions afterwards.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with what you did, what you expected, what happened, and your browser and OS. For
login or passkey problems, include your `RP_ID` and `ORIGIN` (not the contents of `data/`); most
login issues are an origin mismatch.
