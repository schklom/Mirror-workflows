/**
 * A routine slot with another exercise in it (#110): the machine you planned around is gone, or
 * a variation takes over the lift for a block. The slot keeps its place and what was set up for
 * it — sets, reps, weight, rest, warm-ups, the progression rule, the note, its superset — and only
 * the exercise changes. The old way (remove, add, configure again) lost all of that.
 *
 * Some things cannot come along. A cardio slot is minutes at a speed and a lifting slot is sets
 * of reps at a load, so between the two only the note, the rest and the superset carry over and
 * the rest starts from the new exercise's defaults. A load means something else once the new
 * exercise is bodyweight where the old one was not, or the other way round: 60 kg on a bench is
 * not 60 kg added to a push-up. The same goes for an assistance machine, where the number is
 * help rather than load: 40 kg off a pull-up is not 40 kg on a pulldown. There the weight goes
 * back to 0. The bodyweight, assisted and per-side flags describe the movement, not the
 * prescription, so they are dropped and the new exercise follows its own, the way the Coach's
 * swap does (lib/coach.js): a split squat's "per side" would split a back squat's reps into L/R.
 *
 * What is not carried is history. Progress belongs to a routine and an exercise together (#216),
 * so the new exercise starts on its own line — its own sessions in this routine, and until there
 * are any, the slot's numbers — and the old exercise keeps its sessions, ready if it comes back.
 * That is also why the old exercise's weight gives way to the new one's own wherever the new one
 * has been logged (`S`, and the routine `rid` the slot is in): the next session reads a slot
 * weight that differs from the one its last session was planned at as a deliberate edit, and
 * opens there (#275, nextPrescription). An 80 kg barbell bench carried onto dumbbells trained at
 * 30 would open the dumbbells at 80 — and only when the two rep schemes differed, because a
 * plan whose sets and reps match just carries on. With the new exercise's own planned weight in
 * the slot, its history decides either way. One never logged keeps the slot's weight, since
 * there is nothing better to start from.
 *
 * Picking the exercise that is already in the slot replaces nothing, and changes nothing.
