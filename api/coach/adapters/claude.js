/* Claude Agent SDK adapter.
 *
 * Deliberately the SDK rather than a hand-rolled `claude --print`: it brings its own matching
 * runtime, takes the owner's credential only through the child environment, and exposes the
 * switches that keep the model in a text-in / JSON-out lane.
 *
 * Four of those switches are why this adapter can be trusted next to somebody's ./data, and
 * each is a documented option rather than a hopeful one:
 *
 *   tools: []          — "Disable all built-in tools" (SDK Options). No Read, no Bash, no Grep;
 *                        the model has no filesystem tool at all, however it is prompted.
 *   settingSources: [] — no user/project/local settings file is loaded, so nothing on the host
 *                        can widen the line above after the fact.
 *   skills: []         — same reasoning, for skills.
 *   strictMcpConfig    — no MCP server can arrive from ambient config.
 *
 * They are exported as LOCKDOWN and asserted by value in adapters.test.js, so re-enabling one
 * is a red build rather than a quiet capability grant.
 *
 * The import is lazy on purpose. The default image ships without the SDK (see api/Dockerfile),
 * and an absent runtime has to be an ordinary reportable state — check() says so, isConnected()
 * goes false, and no Coach UI is mounted — rather than a boot crash for every instance that
 * never asked for the feature.
