// Floating coach week — the "what's next" rule for web-push reminders. Hand-copied (not
// imported) from frontend/src/lib/queue.js / lib/history.js: the same DONE RULE on both sides,
// kept as a tiny standalone module here (rather than inline in server.js) so it can be
// unit-tested without booting the whole server. `S.queue` is written by a planner — any API
// client that PUTs state with a queue (a coaching agent, a script) — never by the app itself.
//
// DONE RULE: a queue session counts as done once a finished workout on its routine exists,
// started at/after the queue was applied (`S.queue.since`) — or a "past workout" logged with an
// early clock but DATED inside the week (on or after `startsOn`) whose merged name (`'A + B'`)
// names the routine under its current title. The date bound keeps a past week's workout, which
// a planner's reused ids and names can make look identical, from counting. Only finished
// workouts (`S.workouts`) count; an in-progress session never does. Missed sets are the
// planner's business, not the queue's.
