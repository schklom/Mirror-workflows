   not choose better from 1,324 options than from 160. So the slice is capped and balanced: a

   band work — no squat, no hinge, no lunge anywhere in the lane.

   Dropped from the candidate pool, never from the catalogue. One already in someone's plan or
   history is pinned by `keep` below and still travels, because a review has to be able to name
   what it is talking about, and the validator still accepts every id the catalogue holds.

   An equal lane per body part reads fair and is not: it spent as many of the 160 slots on
   "lower arms" (37 rows, wrist curls to a one) as on "chest", and gave "neck" (two rows, both
   stretches) a lane of its own. A plan is not drawn from an even spread of the catalogue's
   taxonomy, so the lanes are weighted by how much programming actually draws on them.

   These are shares, not quotas — a lane that runs out hands its remainder to the others, which
   is what keeps a narrow equipment filter from returning a short slice. Anything not listed
   gets 1, so a body part added to the catalogue later still appears rather than vanishing. */
