// Measurements have to survive every path that carries a profile off this device and back: the
// JSON backup in Settings, and the server sync. Both rebuild state by overlaying the stored blob
// on DEF, so a key missing from DEF — or a server that persists a whitelist instead of the blob —
// drops the history without erroring anywhere. That is the failure this file exists to catch:
// quiet at the time, and only visible a restore later, when the history is already gone.
//
// The store reaches for localStorage and document the moment it is imported, so both are stubbed
// before the dynamic import below. Everything under test is the real DEF and the real normalizer,
// not a restatement of them — a restatement would still pass with the key missing from DEF.
