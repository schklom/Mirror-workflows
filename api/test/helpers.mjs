 * import. Hence dynamic imports everywhere below, and one helper that does it in the right
 * order. node:test runs each file in its own process, so one directory per file is enough.

/* The port a spawned server.js actually bound.
 *
 * Never pick one for it. Opening a listener on 0, reading the port, closing it and handing the
 * number to a child that binds it a process start later leaves a window the kernel re-issues
 * ephemeral ports inside -- 8 repeats in 400 open/close rounds on this box -- and a dozen test
 * files spawn servers at once, so two draw the same number, one child loses the bind and dies,
 * and the other file's server answers on it: a different data dir, a db.json without the test's
 * user, and a 401 where the answer belongs. It cost one unreproducible failure before anyone
 * looked.
 *
 * So the child picks its own port (PORT=0) and says which on its boot line. That line cannot be
 * printed before the socket is bound, which makes it the readiness signal as well -- no polling
 * /api/health, and no waiting on a server that died at boot either.
 *
 * `tail` supplies whatever the caller has collected of the child's output, for the message.
