/**
 * Cascade an explicit work-set load edit through the later inherited work sets.
 *
 * Missing `weightOrigin` is inherited for compatibility with existing sessions. A row or side
 * marked `manual` is an explicit exception, so it stays put even when it is heavier or lighter.
 * `side` narrows a per-side edit to one limb; without it both limbs are eligible independently.
 * Completed rows (and completed limbs) never get rewritten. Clearing an inherited load removes
 * its `w` key just like a direct edit.
 *
 * Only a work-set edit cascades, and only onto work sets. Warm-ups are a ramp (buildSets), each
 * rung its own load, so editing one rung leaves the rungs after it where they were (setting
 * warm-up 1 of a 60/90/105 ramp to 65 used to turn it into 65/65/65).
 *
 * `backoffStep` (an entry built with back-off sets, lib/backoff.js): each later work row lands
 * one more step below the edited one rather than at the same load, so 26 → 27.5 on the top set
 * makes the back-off sets 25.5 and 23.5, not 27.5 three times.
