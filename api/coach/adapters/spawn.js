/* Running a provider CLI as a child process, with the blast radius kept small.
 *
 * Three things matter here and none of them are about convenience:
 *   · no shell, ever — argv is an array, and the user's free text never reaches it anyway
 *     (it travels inside the payload file, as JSON data)
 *   · the environment is built from nothing rather than inherited, so the child cannot read
 *     RP_ID, ADMIN_UIDS, VAPID keys or anything else this process holds
 *   · the child runs as an unprivileged user (created in the Dockerfile) whose uid cannot
 *     read ./data, so a CLI that decided to go looking finds nothing to find

 * itself off silently: `unprivilegedIds()` only returns ids when the server is root, so adding
 * an ordinary `USER node` line to the Dockerfile — a hardening change, made for unrelated
 * reasons — would have left the runtime inheriting the server's uid with nothing to say so.
 * A control that disappears during someone else's refactor is one you find out about late.
 *
 * So on Linux it fails closed: no drop, no job. Elsewhere (a developer's macOS laptop, where
 * there is no `coach` user and no container boundary either) it stays permissive, because the
 * alternative is that the test suite and local development simply stop working.
