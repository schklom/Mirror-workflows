 * Whether completing a set should start a rest timer.

 * A rest belongs after every completed set — the last set of an exercise included, because
 * another exercise follows it and you rest before that one too. The only set with nothing
 * left to time is the last set of the last exercise, where the session is over.
 *
 * Ordinary exercises used to "finish quietly" instead: an exercise started no rest on its
 * closing set, so a two-set exercise timed one rest instead of two (issue #3) and a rest
 * never carried across the gap into the next exercise. Supersets already did it this way.
