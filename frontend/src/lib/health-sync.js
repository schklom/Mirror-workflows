// Health Connect on the Android app (#200): turning it on, and keeping it in step with the log.
// What gets written is worked out in lib/health-connect.js; this file owns the native plugin
// (HealthConnectPlugin.java) and the phone's own record of what it wrote.
//
// It is a fact about this phone, not about the training log: kept in its own file in the app's
// data directory, never in S, so it does not sync to a server, ride in a backup, or switch on a
// second phone. Off until the user turns it on; nothing is asked of Health Connect before that.
//
// The web build never gets here (MOBILE is a build-time flag), and iOS answers 'unsupported'.
