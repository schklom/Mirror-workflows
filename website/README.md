# opengym.duarte-santos.ch

Source of the project website — plain hand-written HTML/CSS/JS, no build step,
served by nginx.

Not in this folder (added at deploy time):

- `img/` — the five screenshots from `../assets/screenshots/` plus `banner.png`
- `icon-180.png` / `icon-512.png` — copied from `../frontend/public/` (the same
  icons the PWA uses, so the browser tab, home screen and app all match)
- `openGym.apk` — the signed release build (see `../docs/MOBILE.md`)
- `demo/` — the browser-only demo build of the app, embedded in the `#demo` section and
  reachable on its own at `/demo/`. Built from `../frontend` with `VITE_DEMO=1` and the
  jsDelivr media bases (see the `pages` job in `../.gitlab-ci.yml`), so the ~140 MB
  of exercise media stays out of it. It has to live on this host: the site frames it, and
  `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` would block it from anywhere else.

`site.js` carries four independent pieces, each one failing soft so the page is
complete without any of them: the phone nav sheet, the scroll reveals, the demo
iframe (injected only once the frame is on screen, and never below 700 px, where
the CSS swaps it for an "open it full-screen" card), and the two things that come
from the public gitlab.com API at view time — the star/issue counts and the About
page's release timeline. Those two URLs pointed at api.github.com until that
account was suspended; they go back once it is restored, together with the notice
block at the top of all three pages.

`styles.css` and `site.js` are cache-busted with `?v=N` — nginx serves the site
with `no-cache, must-revalidate`, but the query bump is what saves a Cloudflare
edge from handing out an old stylesheet with new markup. Bump it on every change.
