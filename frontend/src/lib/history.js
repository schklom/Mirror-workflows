/**
 * Insert a warm-up row at the end of the warm-up block, ramping toward the working weight.
 *
 * Each added row halves what is left between the last warm-up and the first work set, so the
 * first one lands at half the working weight, a second at three quarters, and so on — and a
 * row you edited by hand is what the next one ramps from. `step` is the exercise's own loading
 * step (progression.js's defaultIncrement, passed in by the caller so this module keeps no
 * dependency on progression — that one already imports from here): a warm-up you cannot
 * actually load onto the bar is noise.
 *
 * The reference is the first WORK row, never `rows[at - 1]` alone: for the first warm-up
 * `at` is 0, and reading `rows[-1]` used to fall through to the *last* row — the heaviest
 * work set — so "add warm-up set" handed you a full-weight set to correct by hand.

 * Recompute the warm-up block so it ramps toward the weight the work rows ACTUALLY carry.

 * deliberately rewrites work rows only — so without this the ramp still aims at last
 * session's weight. On a deload that put the last warm-up above every work set, which is
 * the exact opposite of what a warm-up is for.
 *
 * A warm-up already logged keeps its weight and becomes what the next one ramps from: it
 * happened, and rewriting performed work is data loss. Entries with nothing to ramp toward
 * — cardio, bodyweight, an unloaded hold — are returned untouched.
