/* The fake provider: a CLI that speaks the Coach contract without an AI account.
 *
 * Two jobs. In CI it is the whole test surface — every job outcome (a valid plan, a valid
 * change-set, "nothing to change", a malformed answer that the repair round rescues, one that
 * it can't, a timeout, a crash) is one FIXTURE_MODE away, deterministically. On a real
 * instance it is a provider an owner can select to walk the entire loop before connecting a
 * paid account to it.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free and deliberately dumb: it reads the payload the server built,
 * echoes real ids back out of it, and never tries to be a coach. Tests assert on structure.
