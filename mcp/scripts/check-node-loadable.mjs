/* Does the server's import graph still load under plain node?
 *
 * This exists because the test suite cannot answer that question. `npm test` runs vitest, and
 * vitest resolves modules through Vite — `import.meta.glob`, `?raw`, a stray `.jsx` import all
 * work there. The server does not run under Vite. So a Vite-only import can land in a shared
 * lib module, leave all 33 tests green, and still kill the server at startup. That is exactly
 * what happened once: `history.js` began importing `t` from `i18n.js` (import.meta.glob over
 * the locale packs, plus React), and the server died on `import` with the suite none the wiser.
 *
 * Run by bare `node` on purpose — being outside vitest IS the check. Do not port this to a
 * vitest test file; that would make it pass unconditionally.
 *
 * Importing the two entry modules is enough on its own: everything the server touches hangs off
 * them, so a lib module that grows a browser-only dependency next year fails here without this
 * list being updated. The named list below only exists to point at the culprit instead of at a
 * stack trace ten frames deep.
