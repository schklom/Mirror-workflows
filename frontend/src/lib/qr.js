// QR rendering for the gym check-in cards (mobile-only feature — see views/CheckIn.jsx).

// We never store a photo of a membership card, only its decoded value (+ its symbology in
// `fmt`). The picture a turnstile scanner reads is regenerated from that value every time the
// card is shown, here.
//
// lean-qr (MIT, see NOTICE.md) is loaded with a dynamic import so its ~4kB never lands in the
// web bundle — the whole feature is gated behind MOBILE, but the library itself is plain JS a
// static import would otherwise pull into every build.
//
// Scope: lean-qr generates QR codes only. A gym card is virtually always a QR code, and the
// capture flow (lib/scan.js) refuses any symbology we cannot faithfully reproduce, so a stored
// card is guaranteed renderable here — canRenderFmt() is the single source of that truth, shared
// by both sides.
