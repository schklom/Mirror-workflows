/* A push subscription's `endpoint` is a URL this server connects out to, chosen by whoever is
   signed in — so without a check /api/push/* is a request-forgery lever, and the api container
   sits on the same Docker network as the rest of the self-hoster's stack. Three limits below:

   1. PUSH_AGENT rejects any connection to a private/loopback/link-local address at the moment
      the socket is opened. Validating the URL alone would leave a DNS-rebinding window — the
      name is resolved a second time inside web-push — so the check has to live in the lookup
      the request itself uses, not in a prior pass. A literal IP address never goes through
      that lookup at all — Node hands it straight to connect() — so literals are judged by
      pushEndpointError instead: at subscribe, and again in sendPush for an endpoint that got
      into db.json some other way.
   2. PUSH_TIMEOUT_MS: an endpoint that accepts TCP and then stalls used to hang the request
      handler that awaited it, indefinitely. web-push sets no timeout of its own.
   3. PUSH_CONCURRENCY: one small request must not turn into an unbounded burst of outbound
      connections (with MAX_SUBS_PER_USER below, that is the other half of the same problem). */

/* ---------- sign-in throttle ---------- */
// The password routes are counted (rate-limit.js) — only on an instance with PASSWORD_LOGIN on,
// since none of them exists otherwise — and so are the two that redeem a device link (#95).
// Passkey sign-in, passkey registration and phone pairing stay out of it, as they always were:
// nothing there is worth guessing (an assertion is a signature, an invite code 64 random bits, a
// pairing code 40 bits that live five minutes, one per profile), and behind a proxy that hands the
// API one address for every visitor a per-address count on them would let one stranger pause
// everybody's way in. Their failures are still written to the audit log, but only a few per
// address a minute (auditFail below), so a flood of junk cannot push everything else out of it. A
// device-link code is 60 bits that live ten minutes, no more worth guessing than a pairing code,
// but it is counted the way a reset code is: every wrong one is a guess at a way into somebody's
// profile, and the pause it can start only ever stops link redemption, never a sign-in.
// Three counts:
//
//   AUTH_BURST   every request to a counted route, 60 a minute per address. Enough for a
//                household behind one proxy; not enough to run scrypt as fast as one client
//                can ask.
//   ADDR_FAILS   wrong answers per address and per kind (a password or reset code, an invite
//                code on password signup, a device-link code): 20 free, then a pause of 30 s
//                that doubles up to 15 min.
//   ACCOUNT_FAILS  wrong passwords per *account*, whoever sends them: 5 free, then 1 min
//                doubling up to 1 h, forgotten after a day without one or on the next success.
//                This is the one that protects a password — an address is cheap to change, an
//                account is not. It is keyed by the account the name or e-mail resolves to
//                (`acct:<id>`), so typing the e-mail after the name was paused meets the same
//                pause; an identifier that resolves to nobody is counted as typed (`id:<fold>`),
//                so a pause looks the same whether an account is there or not. The count of an
//                account with a password is never evicted to make room for others. Passkeys
//                are never paused by it.
//
// A password check is counted against the name and the address the moment it starts, not when
// its answer comes back (passwordAttempt below): scrypt takes a tenth of a second, and counting
// afterwards let a burst sent at once be checked in full under a single allowance.
//
// Behind a proxy every request can come from the same address (the bundled web container passes
// the real one on; a second proxy in front of it may not). Then the per-address counts act for
// the whole instance: one client can pause *password* sign-in for everybody for a while, and the

//
// The name someone signs in with is their profile name, compared the way nameKey() folds it.

// also re-checked after every await, where another request could have taken it meanwhile.
//
// An unused reset code holds its profile's name too. The reset has already removed the old

/* ---------- e-mail as a sign-in name ----------
   Optional, per profile, and only while PASSWORD_LOGIN is on: an address someone may type at the
   password sign-in instead of their profile name. Nothing is ever sent to it — no verification,
   no reset mail; resets stay the admin's one-time code — so the address is never proven to be
   theirs, and it does not need to be: it is only an identifier that points at an account, and the
   password is still what opens it. Stored as `u.email`, folded by normalizeEmail() (password.js).

   It is unique across every profile, and no profile's address may be another password-holding
   profile's name (nameTaken above says the same the other way round), so an identifier never
   points at two accounts. That uniqueness is the one thing an address reveals: setting one that
   is in use answers 409. The route could be made to hide it — accept the address silently and
   leave it pointing nowhere — but then someone who typed their own address on a second profile
   would be told it was saved and find it did not sign in, which is worse. So it answers, and the
   answer is made expensive instead: in Settings only a signed-in owner can ask (session +
   proveOwner, a passkey prompt or a checked password per try), an address already in use counts
   against the caller's address and account (20 free, then 30 s doubling to 15 min), and profile
   creation with a password and an address counts the same way against the caller's address.
   Signup needs no session, so it is the cheaper place to ask: it answers only after hashing the
   new password and, on an invite-only instance, only to someone holding a valid invite code
   (a refusal does not use it up); an open instance answers anyone. What that leaves is what the name-taken answer already gives
   away for names — "some profile here uses this", never which one — at a few tries an hour.

   Sign-in takes it in the same field as the name (loginTarget): an identifier with an "@" is
   looked up as an address first, then as a name, so a profile name that happens to contain an
   "@" still signs in. Wrong passwords count against the account the identifier resolves to, so
   switching between name and address does not reset the pause. The full address is never
   written to the audit log or the console (maskEmail), is not part of /api/me, the Coach, the
   MCP bridge or anything shared, and only its owner (GET /api/account/password) and an admin
   (the user list) ever see it. */

/* ---------- more than one passkey, and one-time device links (#95) ---------- */
// A passkey lives where it was made — Windows Hello on one PC, one phone's keychain, one security
// key — so a profile that only had the passkey it was created with could not be reached from a
// second device, and "Create profile" there made a new, empty one. Two ways to add another:
//
//   Settings → Passkeys → Add: a registration ceremony in the signed-in browser, for any other
//   authenticator it can reach — a security key, a password manager, a phone through the
//   browser's own QR prompt.
//
//   A device link: the signed-in device shows a one-time code (device-link.js), and the other
//   device redeems it by creating a passkey of its own, which is what then signs it in. The code
//   never opens a session by itself: whoever redeems it leaves a passkey on the profile, listed
//   in Settings where the owner sees it and can remove it.
//
// Either way the new passkey is a way into the profile that outlives "sign out everywhere", so
// both ask for the proof a first password does (proveOwner). So does removing one: a stolen
// cookie must not choose which of the owner's passkeys is left. Removing one never leaves a
// profile without a way in: its last passkey stays unless a password can sign in instead.
//
// Sessions are not tied to the passkey that opened them — a session is `uid:expiry:version`,
// nothing more — so removing a passkey stops it signing in again but does not end a session it
// already opened. "Sign out everywhere" does that, and Settings says so where a passkey is removed.
