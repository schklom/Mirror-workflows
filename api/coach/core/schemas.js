/* JSON schemas for the three answer shapes, handed to providers that can enforce a schema
 * while decoding (Ollama/llama.cpp grammar sampling, LM Studio, vLLM, OpenAI json_schema).
 *
 * Deliberately flat: no $ref, no anyOf/oneOf, no additionalProperties tricks — llama.cpp's
 * grammar converter has a history of choking on those (ollama#8444, #8063). The schema
 * guarantees *shape* so a small model cannot ramble; validate.js remains the only judge of
 * whether the contents are safe to act on. Fields that may hold any JSON value (`before`,
 * `after`) say so with a type union, which the grammar converter does support.
