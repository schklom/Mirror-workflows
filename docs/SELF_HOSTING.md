# Self-hosting openGym

openGym is two small containers (a web server and an API) plus a folder of your data.
This guide takes you from "just cloned it" to "using it from my phone over the internet".

## 1. Run it locally (5 minutes)

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with the Compose plugin.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/DuarteSantos8/opengym
cd openGym
cp .env.example .env
docker compose pull   # prebuilt images from GitLab (amd64 + arm64) — or skip and build from source
docker compose up -d
```

- First start downloads the exercise images/GIFs (~140 MB) once into `media/img` and `media/gif`.
- Open **http://localhost:8080** and create a profile with a passkey.
- Rather build from source than pull prebuilt images? Skip `docker compose pull` and run
  `docker compose up -d --build` instead — no Node needed locally either way.

Check it's healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health      # {"ok":true,...}
```

Logs: `docker compose logs -f`. Stop: `docker compose down`.

## 2. Understand the passkey requirement (important)

openGym signs you in with **passkeys** (WebAuthn). Browsers enforce two rules:

1. Passkeys are bound to an exact **hostname** (`RP_ID`).
2. They only work over **HTTPS** — with one exception: `http://localhost`.

So `http://localhost:8080` works on the machine running Docker, but **another device (your
phone) cannot use `http://<your-LAN-ip>:8080`** — that's neither localhost nor HTTPS, so the
passkey prompt won't appear. To use openGym from your phone you need a real HTTPS hostname.

(You can still open it over LAN in **guest mode**, which stores data only in that browser.)

## 3. Expose it over HTTPS on your own domain

Put openGym behind something that terminates TLS for a hostname you control, then point it at
the `web` container. Pick whichever you already run:

### Option A — Cloudflare Tunnel (no open ports)

1. Create a tunnel and route `gym.example.com` → `http://<docker-host>:8080`.
2. Cloudflare gives you HTTPS automatically.

### Option B — Caddy (automatic Let's Encrypt)

```caddy
gym.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

### Option C — Traefik / nginx / Nginx Proxy Manager

Route `gym.example.com` (HTTPS) → `web:80` (or `<docker-host>:8080`). Any reverse proxy works —
openGym only needs the browser to reach it over `https://gym.example.com`.

Then set your domain in `.env` and restart:

```bash
# .env
RP_ID=gym.example.com
ORIGIN=https://gym.example.com
WEB_PORT=8080
RP_NAME=openGym
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `https://gym.example.com`, create your profile, and add it to your home screen
(iOS: Share → Add to Home Screen · Android: ⋮ → Add to Home screen).

> Changing `RP_ID` later invalidates existing passkeys (they were bound to the old hostname).
> Pick your domain before people register.

## 4. Multiple users

Anyone who can reach the URL can create their own profile — each gets isolated data. That's the
default: open signup, no admin.

If you'd rather control who gets in, three optional settings in `.env` turn that around:

```bash
ADMIN_UIDS=youruserid      # comma-separated; these users get the admin dashboard
INVITE_ONLY=1              # new profiles need an invite code
ALLOW_GUEST=0              # remove "Continue without account"
```

Register your own passkey profile first, then find your id in `./data/db.json` under `users[].id`
and put it in `ADMIN_UIDS`. You'll get an **Admin dashboard** link in Settings: who's training
right now, each user's workout history and body weight, the ability to disable an account (signed
out and locked out everywhere until you re-enable it), and — with `INVITE_ONLY=1` — generating and
revoking invite codes. Existing accounts keep working when you switch invite-only on. Admin access
is gated by your passkey and enforced server-side, so it needs no separate login.

### The activity log

The dashboard also keeps an **activity log**: sign-ins, sign-outs, failed attempts, refused
signups, and every admin action (disabling an account, creating or revoking an invite code). It
lives in `./data/audit.log` as one JSON object per line, so `tail -f data/audit.log` and `jq`
work on it directly, and the dashboard reads the same file.

It is on by default and keeps the last 5,000 events or 90 days, whichever comes first
(`AUDIT_LOG=0` turns it off entirely; `AUDIT_MAX` and `AUDIT_DAYS` change the caps). **IP
addresses are not recorded** unless you set `AUDIT_IP=net` (network only, e.g. `203.0.113.0/24`)
or `AUDIT_IP=full`. Neither the browser's user-agent nor the passkey id of a failed sign-in is
ever stored: the first is a fingerprint, and the second would let you follow an unknown device
from one attempt to the next.

Two things worth expecting. **Guests never appear** — guest mode never talks to the server, so
there is nothing to log, exactly as there is nothing for the rest of the dashboard to show. And
**a disabled account goes quiet**: a disabled user is refused at the session check, so their only
entries are the failed sign-ins they keep making.

Clearing the log from the dashboard records the clear itself, and the event ids keep counting, so
a gap is always visible.

`INVITE_ONLY=1` and `ALLOW_GUEST=0` answer different questions and are usually set together.
Invite-only controls who may *create a profile*; it says nothing about the **Continue without
account** button, which never creates one. Guest mode keeps everything in that browser and never
talks to the server — there is no account, no sync and nothing for the admin dashboard to show —
so on an instance meant for a known set of people it is a door that leads nowhere useful. With
`ALLOW_GUEST=0` the button is gone, and anyone already using the app as a guest is returned to the
login screen on their next visit. Their data is not deleted: it stays in that browser and comes
back if you ever switch guests on again, or moves into a real profile if they create one on the
same device.

Prefer to keep the whole thing off the open internet? A VPN or an auth proxy (Authelia, Cloudflare
Access…) in front still works, and composes with the above.

## 5. Fitting it into an existing stack

The defaults assume openGym is the only thing here: a service called `api` on port 3000, and nginx
on port 80 inside its container. If you are merging this into a compose file that already has an
`api`, or you put the web container behind your own reverse proxy on a different port, four
settings in `.env` move those without editing any config file:

```bash
WEB_PORT=8080              # host port — what you browse to
NGINX_PORT=80              # port the web container listens on, inside the container
BACKEND=api                # name of the API service that /api is proxied to
PORT=3000                  # port the API listens on; web proxies to the same value
SESSION_DAYS=90            # how long a sign-in lasts
```

The web image renders its nginx config from these when the container starts, so they take effect
on a **prebuilt image** — no rebuild. `BACKEND` and `PORT` together are what `/api` is proxied to,
so they have to name a service the web container can actually reach on your compose network.

Note the difference from `VITE_IMG_BASE` / `VITE_GIF_BASE` (see Troubleshooting): those are
build-time values baked into the frontend bundle, and setting them next to `docker compose` does
nothing to an image you pulled.

## 6. Backups

Everything is in `./data`:

```bash
tar czf opengym-backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz data/
```

That archive contains all profiles, passkeys and workout history — and, if the activity log is
on, `audit.log` with everyone's sign-in times. Worth knowing before you ship the archive to a
backup service you don't run. Restore by unpacking it back into the project folder. (Individual
users can also export their own data as JSON from Settings.)

## 7. Notifications

openGym can push two kinds of alert to your phone/desktop, even when the app isn't open:
rest-timer-over, and a reminder on days you have a workout planned but haven't logged one yet.
Turn it on per-profile in **Settings → Notifications** (requires a signed-in passkey profile and
HTTPS — see section 3).

No setup needed server-side, and nothing to configure per timezone: VAPID keys are generated on
first run and saved to `./data/vapid.json`, and each user's browser reports its own timezone
automatically when they turn the reminder on — it fires at their local time, and follows them if
they travel, regardless of what timezone the server itself runs in.

**Keep screen awake** (Settings → *During a workout*) has the same transport requirement: the
Wake Lock API is only available over HTTPS or on `http://localhost`, so on a plain-LAN-IP
instance the switch shows as unsupported. Nothing to configure server-side either way, and iOS
refuses the lock while the phone is in Low Power Mode.

Push services like a contact address for whoever runs the server, in case they ever need to reach
you about your pushes. openGym sends your `ORIGIN` by default; set `VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:you@example.com`
in `.env` if you would rather they had an inbox.

## 8. Updating

Running prebuilt images:

```bash
git pull                    # picks up compose/config changes
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Building from source instead:

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app shell is versioned (`?v=N`) so clients pick up changes on next load. Your `./data` and the
downloaded media are untouched.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| No passkey prompt on my phone | You're on `http://` or an IP, not HTTPS. Set up a domain (section 3). |
| "verification failed" on login | `RP_ID`/`ORIGIN` don't match the URL in the address bar. Make them exact, restart. |
| Media didn't download | `docker compose logs media`. Re-run `docker compose up -d`, or run `./scripts/fetch-media.sh`. |
| Port 8080 already used | Set `WEB_PORT=9090` in `.env` (and update `ORIGIN` for local testing). |
| No "Notifications" option in Settings | Requires a signed-in profile and HTTPS (or `localhost`) — guest mode and plain HTTP over LAN can't subscribe. |
| Day reminder fires at the wrong time | Toggle it off and on in Settings so it re-detects your browser's timezone (also happens automatically on every app load — see section 7). |
| Want to reset a stuck login | Delete the cookie in your browser; sessions are just signed cookies. |
| `docker compose pull` fails with "denied" / "unauthorized" | The prebuilt images aren't published yet, or need to be, or the GHCR package is still private — build from source instead (`docker compose up -d --build`). |
| Exercise images/GIFs blank when a routine is open | Fixed in current images (issue #79). On an older build, see the note below. |

### `VITE_IMG_BASE` / `VITE_GIF_BASE` are build-time, not run-time

These two are read by Vite when the frontend is **compiled**, so their values are baked into
the shipped JavaScript bundle. Setting them in the `.env` next to `docker compose` has no
effect on an already-built image — the bundle has already made up its mind.

They are only useful if you build the frontend yourself (`docker compose up -d --build`, or a
`npm run build` with the variables exported). If you need to redirect media on a prebuilt
image, do it in your reverse proxy instead.
