/* Per-set progress (issue #145): Stats → Exercise progress drawn as one line per set number, so
 * the set you drop off on shows up — which is often not the last one.
 *
 * A set's number is its place among the session's working sets of this exercise, in reps mode:
 * warm-ups are not counted, a set left undone keeps its number (set 4 never reads as set 3), a
 * per-side set is one set, and a drop set or rest-pause set is plotted at its main set. The same
 * exercise twice in one workout keeps counting across both entries. Pure, so the chart and the
 * tests read the same thing. */
