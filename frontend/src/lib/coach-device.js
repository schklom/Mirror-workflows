// Mobile build only: how the Coach runs on this phone, and the little it keeps between runs.
//
// Deliberately NOT part of S. S is the training log — it syncs to a paired server, travels in
// the JSON export, and is what "back up your data" means. Which provider this phone talks to,
// the pseudonym it uses, today's run count and a proposal waiting to be looked at are device
// facts, so they live in their own file next to the remote-pairing one. The API key itself is
// not even here: see coach-secrets.js.
//
// This module is intentionally light. The setup screen imports it before the user has chosen
// anything, and the promise there is that nothing AI-shaped loads until they do.
