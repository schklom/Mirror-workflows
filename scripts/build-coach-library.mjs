 * The API needs the catalogue for two things the client cannot do for it: validating that
 * every exercise id a proposal references actually exists (FR-16), and building payloads for
 * scheduled reviews, which run with nobody's browser open. Rather than teach the api build to
 * reach into frontend/, the index is generated and committed — the same arrangement the
 * translated instruction packs in src/instr/ already use.
 *
 * Only the fields the Coach reasons over are kept: an id, a name, and the three taxonomy
 * fields it filters on. Instructions, images and secondary muscles stay out — they would
 * quadruple a payload the model has no use for.
