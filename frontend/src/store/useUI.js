     when a rest displaced the hold (abandonWork).

// as held to the end. The workout screen binds its own handler again (bindWork), and until it
// does the time still lands on the set (ownerDone). Only the start, total and owner are kept:
// the tick reads `endsAt`, so what it shows after the reload is what the clock says.
