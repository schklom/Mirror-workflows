// Rotation — the in-app half of the queue (lib/queue.js).
//
//   S.rotation = null | { id: string, sequence: string[], label: string }
//
// `S.rotation` is a DEFINITION, never a live queue: what the calendar, the reminders and the MCP
// resolve is always `S.queue`. `scheduleModeOf` is Home/Plan's own display choice: a live queue
// always wins regardless of `S.scheduleMode` (an external writer never has to know the flag
// exists), and the flag itself exists only to hold Rotation selected — weekday grid hidden, both
// screens showing the rotation editor — from the moment it is chosen through to the first
// routine being added, since there is no queue yet at that point to derive anything from.
//
// OWNERSHIP — `S.queue.rotationId === S.rotation.id` marks a pass this app manages: only such a
// pass refills itself when it completes. A planner's queue omits `rotationId`, so it completes
// and waits for its writer; saving it from Plan's editor adopts it (stamps the id) and opts it
// into refill from that point on. The token also stops a stale saved rotation from reclaiming
// somebody else's queue that happens to hold the same routine ids.
//
// THE ONE-DAY BOUNDARY — a new pass created by a completion starts the day AFTER the workout
// that closed the old one. The done rule (queue.js) credits a workout dated on or after
// `startsOn` whose name matches the routine even when its `start` predates `since` — the
// fallback for an early or unreliable clock. Without the boundary the session that finished the
// old pass would immediately tick an item of the new one.
