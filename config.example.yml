# This is an example config file for FMD Server

# Warning: if you use a config file but remove some keys, the YAML parser will
# assign YAML's default values to these keys, e.g., an empty string or the integer 0.
# This is important for ports: on Linux, port 0 will select a random port.
# Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly configure all options.

# Permissions to set on the socket after it is created. If < 0, no
# modifications are made. This considered insecure practice, if you
# do it, consider setting a umask for the daemon user before starting it.

# If RegistrationToken is non-empty, FMD Server will require the FMD app to provide this token during registration.
