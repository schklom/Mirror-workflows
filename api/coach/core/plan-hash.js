/**
 * Fingerprint of the plan a proposal was computed against (FR-32). Takes the output of
 * `canonicalPlan`, so both runtimes hash the same normalised shape; the client mirrors this
 * function exactly. A mismatch therefore means the plan genuinely moved — not that two
 * implementations disagree about key order or about what "no weight" looks like.
 *
 * The field list must stay in step with `canonicalPlan`. It did not: that function learned
 * `repsMax`, `bodyweight` and `side` when the payload did, and this one kept hashing the
 * pre-1.2.4 list, so a plan whose rep ceiling had been raised by hand fingerprinted as
 * untouched — which is exactly the edit a proposal about bodyweight progression is stalest
 * against.
