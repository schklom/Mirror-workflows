When reporting bugs, please use the "Bug Report" template from the dropdown menu.

If your error message contains a "permission denied", please re-read the README,
read through existing issues, and really make sure that the permission are set correctly.
The standard set-up is tested, so if something doesn't work, it is probably a configuration issue on your side.
Try to debug it yourself before opening an issue.

Every issue and every comment ("I have the same problem") creates email traffic for the maintainers, which keeps them from doing development work.
